The five languages in this datasets were part of the first version of the [CLICS](https://clics.lingpy.org) database, which has by now been superseded by [CLICSÂ²](https://clics.clld.org). Since the data from this datasets were not yet included in any dataset of the new CLICS database, have have added them here.
